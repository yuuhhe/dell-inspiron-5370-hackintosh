# Enabling HiDPI support

If you have ever wanted to enable HiDPI support on your laptop, you can do it by following those simple steps:

1. Clone [one-key-hidpi](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi/)
2. Select `(2) Enable HIDPI (with EDID)`
3. Select your custom icon (personally I left it as default by using `(6) Do not change`)
4. Select your default resolution (mine is `1920x1080`)
5. Reboot your computer

##### Please note that `Rebooting the logo for the first time will become huge, then it will not be.`
